How to install
==============

In you have Nim and Nimble installed, type:

  $ nimble install bio

How to get/read the docs
========================

With the nimble tool, as easy as typing in the root of the repo:

  $ nimble repodocs

The script creates a "htmldocs" directory, scans the source code for docs,
runs the embedded doc-tests and finally build the documentation as a webpage.
Open the file "htmldocs/index.html" in any browser.

The "htmldocs" directory can be moved around to any place of your convenience.

How to work with me
===================

This library doesn't provide any functionality as executables out of the box.
Refer to the Tutorial and Cookbook in the Documentation you generated above to
get a glimpse of what you can do with it.
