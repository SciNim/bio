# Straight from the Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format
#
# A FASTQ file normally uses four lines per sequence.
#
#  Line 1 begins with a '@' character and is followed by a sequence identifier
#    and an optional description (like a FASTA title line).
#  Line 2 is the raw sequence letters.
#  Line 3 begins with a '+' character and is *optionally* followed by the same
#    sequence identifier (and any description) again.
#  Line 4 encodes the quality values for the sequence in Line 2, and must
#    contain the same number of symbols as letters in the sequence.
#
# Quality:
#   ASCII character by adding 64 to the Phred value
#   A Phred score of a base is: Qphred = âˆ’10*log(e) , e is the probability of
#     the base being wrong.

#
# The logic has to change:
#  - Find the first @
#  - Read Sequence until +
#  - Read Quality until len(quality) == len(sequence)
#  - Repeat (check that a new @ exists)
